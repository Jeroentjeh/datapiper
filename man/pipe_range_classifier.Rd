\title{Generates features for regression problems through classification}
\usage{
pipe_range_classifier(train, response_col, exclude_columns = response_col,
  tolerable_performance_reduction = 0.2,
  base_temporary_column_name = "base_temporary_column_name",
  base_definitive_column_name = paste0(response_col, "_quantile"),
  quantiles = 10, even_spreads, values, model = c("glm"), controls)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{Data frame containing the train data.}

\item{response_col}{String denoting the name of the column that should be used as the response_col variable.}

\item{exclude_columns}{Columns that shouldn't be used in the models. Defaults to the response column and will ALWAYS include the response column.}

\item{tolerable_performance_reduction}{If \code{test} contains the response column, we will test each model if it's good enough.
We will calculate the AUC of each model on train and test sets and if the AUC on test is bigger than \code{1-tolerable_performance_reduction} times the model is deemed good enough.}

\item{base_temporary_column_name}{Base name that will be used to create a temporary variable for training the classifier. Use this to ensure no existing columns are overwritten.}

\item{base_definitive_column_name}{Base name that will be used to store the predictions of the created classifiers. Will be appended by the threshold value.
Use this to ensure no existing columns are overwritten.}

\item{quantiles}{Number of quantiles to use to generate threshold values. Will actually generate \code{quantiles+2} quantiles and look at 2nd to \code{quantiles+1}-th
quantiles to remove non-sensical thresholds. Non-negative integer, defaults to 10.}

\item{even_spreads}{Number of evenly spread thresholds to use. These will be based on the minimum and maximum value of the response_col in \code{train}. Defines its thresholds simarly to \code{quantiles}}

\item{values}{Threshold values to use. We will check if these fall in the range of the response_col in \code{train}.}

\item{model}{Type of model to use. Currently only binomial glm is available.}

\item{controls}{Parameters for the models to use. Leave empty or set to NA to use defaults:
\itemize{
\item glm: \code{\link[stats]{glm.control}}
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the transformed train dataset and a trained pipe.
}
\description{
Use classification models to classify if the response is larger than a series of given values for regression tasks
}
\details{
If multiple values out of \code{quantiles}, \code{even_spreads}, or \code{values} are chosen, all options will be applied.
