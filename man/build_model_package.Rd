\item{trained_pipeline}{The model function from \code{find_best_models}}

\item{package_name}{The name of the package}

\item{libraries}{A list of library names required by the package. Defaults to all loaded non-base packages}

\item{tar_file}{The name and path of the final tarred package}

\item{prediction_precision}{Number of digits to be returned by the prediction}

\item{may_overwrite_tar_file}{Flag indicating if, when \code{tar_file} exists, this function is allowed to override it.}

\details{
A tip for finding out which libraries you need: start with just datapiper, build the package and check the output of building the package.
It will display which functions you use that aren't included yet.
